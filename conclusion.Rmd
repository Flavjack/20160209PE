# Conclusions

The viability of germination and oil content in *Jatropha curcas* seeds can be maintained, provided there is control of moisture in the interstices of the seed during storage. Salinity strongly affects the germination and initial development of *Jatropha curcas* L., and of the evaluated genotypes, 114, 171 and 183 present as potential candidates for future breeding programs.
