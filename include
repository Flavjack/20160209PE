Seeds of oleaginous plants, such as those of the physic nut of Jatropha are more difficult to preserve than starchy seeds because lipids are less stable molecules than starch (Pereira et al. 2013). The peroxidation of lipids, loss of cell membrane integrity and the leakage of electrolytes result in rapid loss of vigour and viability in such seeds (MacDonald Jr 1999). In Jatropha seed, Moncaleano-Escandon et al. (2013) found that germination and vigour were lost in storage due to heightened metabolism which continued even under low levels of water in the seed, depleting seed reserves, and the occurrence of high levels of reducing sugars in the seed that triggered glycosylation of proteins and then peroxidation of lipids, leading to electrolyte leakage and damage to the embryo. The rate of deterioration of seed under storage mainly depends on temperature and humidity; high temperatures and humidity during storage increase the rate of deterioration and loss of germination, vigour and viability of seeds (MacDonald Jr 1999) while low temperatures and humidity increase the storage life of seeds (Castellion et al. 2010). The first objective of this study was to determine the effect of duration of storage of Jatropha seed at room temperature on oil content, viability, germination and seedling growth.
