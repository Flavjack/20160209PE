# Discussion

The seeds of *J. curcas*, because they are classified as orthodox [@hay2013advances], resistant to desiccation, can often present water contents up to 18% [@pompelli2010environmental] when freshly harvested. Moncaleano-Escandon [@moncaleano2013germination], showed that the seeds of *J. curcas* can drastically reduce their germinability during storage at temperatures of 4 °C or 25 °C, accompanied by the reduction of some compounds such as starch and total soluble proteins. This author also showed that at 4ºC it was more interesting for the storage of seeds of this species. In this work, it was observed that the reduction of the relative humidity in the interstice of the seeds with the use of desiccant material reduced the water content of the seeds and decreased the water potential, helping to maintain the germinability of the seeds during the storage without significant reduction. In relation to the physiological characteristics, a reduction in the concentration of total soluble proteins and in total soluble amino acids, probably to provide energy to the embryo, could be observed that remained viable during the storage period. Similarly to that described previously, the total soluble carbohydrates content must have been reduced by the metabolism of sucrose, which acted as the carbon source for the embryo. Circumstantial evidence of this idea is based on the elevation of glucose and fructose contents while there has been a reduction in the levels of starch and sucrose. However, even under these conditions, the seeds remained viable, with expressive levels of respiration, which allowed the viability of the embryo at the expense of the solubilization of reserves. Such a hypothesis can be corroborated by the strong negative correlation between oil, starch and sucrose contents with degradation products (i.e. total soluble proteins, total soluble amino acids and glucose). Some of these responses are distinct from those previously described for species  [@moncaleano2013germination]. It should be noted that in the work of Moncaleano-Escandon  [@moncaleano2013germination] there was no change in moisture in the interstice of the seeds, a fact that was taken into account in this study. In addition, it was reported that seeds containing between 6% and 8% of moisture had a rapid reduction in seed oil content in the first 3 months of storage, together with an increase in the concentration of free fatty acids [@akowuah2012influence; @worang2008quality]. Important parameters in this culture. Thus, it is verified that the moisture control in the interstice of the seeds should be taken into account to preserve both the viability and the oil content of the seeds of *J. curcas*.

The negative effects of saline stress were reflected in the delay in the germination period, from 3 days in the control and up to 13 days in 150 mM NaCl in the irrigation water, which is confirmed by the significant reduction in germination percentage and mean germination time [@alencar2015ultrastructural]. Regardless of the storage time, germination was initiated between the third and fifth day, with complete finishing after 23 days of sowing, which occurred mainly with 12 months of storage. Both salinity and storage delayed germination; But among them, storage seems to be the factor that slows down germinability with greater magnitude. It was observed that the germination synchrony was reduced with the increase of the salts concentration, and the salinity stress promoted slow and more disorganized germination, a fact corroborated by the high values of germination uncertainty. Thus, it is verified that the synchrony and the uncertainty of the germination of the seeds can not be considered good parameters for judgment, at least in *J. curcas*. A possible explanation for this could arise from the fact that J. curcas is not yet a domesticated species [@achten2010towards], which makes it present high levels of uncertainty in germination [@ranal2006and]; A factor highly related to the survival of the species in its original habitat [@maes2009climatic] and very unstable from the physiological point of view.

The salinity experiment reveals that *J. curcas* can tolerate up to 150 mM NaCl in the irrigation water for seed germination, although it has difficulties for the development of the seedlings in concentrations above 75 mM of NaCl, occurring a reduction in the accumulation of biomass , A fact that may even lead to the death of the plant. A possible explanation for this is presented by Alencar [@alencar2015ultrastructural] as an increase of the Na + and Cl- contents in the embryonic axes and in the endosperm of the seeds of *J. curcas*; Or the loss of mobilization of cotyledon reserves on germination [@liu2010seed] affecting seedling establishment [@marques2013increased]. The delay of the germination accompanied with the decrease of the development of the leaves and the reduction of the root growth promotes delay of the autotrophic phase of the plants that, in extreme cases, leads to the death of the same one. Even if the cumulative germination is different for the different genotypes, a marked tendency can be observed between the salinity and the reduction in the germination and the accumulation of biomass. Among the parameters of biomass allocation, the PRC showed a strong increase with salinity. It is common for plants to increase their stem biomass to the detriment of other organs when subjected to salinity [@dantas2007germination; @munns1986whole; @praxedes2010salt]. Munns [@munns1986whole] describes this as an indirect effect of decreasing water uptake by roots and lower leaf expansion, while Praxedes [@praxedes2010salt] describes this effect as lower relative growth rate of the plant as a whole. On the other hand, Bayuelo-Jiménez [@bayuelo2002salinity] and Debez [@debez2004salinity] describe that all biometric components are reduced in plants submitted to salinity, whether this species is salinity sensitive [@bayuelo2002salinity] or a halophyte [@debez2004salinity]. In addition, Hasewaga [@hasegawa2000plant] attributed this reduction and / or inhibition of plant growth, when subjected to salinity, to a number of factors such as changes in the water status of the plant caused by the osmotic effect of the salts, increase in the concentration of toxic ions, Producing physiological and biochemical variations and alteration in the absorption of essential nutrients. Principal component analysis showed that the biometric parameters better explain the salinity response than the germination parameters. Genotypes 114, 171 and 183 are possible candidates for salt stress tolerance, whereas genotypes 133 and 218 show sensitivity to NaCl addition in irrigation water.
