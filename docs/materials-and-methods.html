<p><strong>Aging tests.</strong> To test the effect of storage on seed viability, an artificial aging test was used to reduce the water content in the interstices of the seeds with a desiccant material composed of silica gel (Sigma-Aldrish, No. 10087). The genotype used in this experiment was 171 from Maceió, Alagoas. In each experimental unit 50 seeds of <em>J. curcas</em>, arranged in germination boxes (110 x 110 x 35 mm) were added under a stainless steel mesh suspended 2 cm from the desiccant. Five storage times (i.e., 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 months) were tested and stored under refrigerator condition at a temperature set at 4 ± 2 °C. After each storage period, the seeds were placed to germinate.</p>
<p><strong>Biochemical analysis of the seeds used in the aging test.</strong> A portion of 10% of the samples in each storage period was carefully ground in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 °C until use. For the analysis of total soluble carbohydrates (TSC), total soluble amino acids (TSA) and starch (STR), the samples were solubilized in 50% (v/v) ethanol <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-trethewey1998combined">35</a>]</span>, whereas for analysis of total soluble proteins (TSP), the samples were extracted in Stitt buffer <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-armengaud2009multilevel">36</a>]</span>. The methodologies described in Dubois <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-dubois1956colorimetric">37</a>]</span>, Bradford <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-bradford1976rapid">38</a>]</span> and Moore and Stein <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-moore1954modified">39</a>]</span> were used for the analysis of starch, total soluble carbohydrates, total soluble proteins and soluble amino acids, respectively. For the quantification of the oil content (OIL) the methodology described in detail by Ahmad <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-ahmad1981ricinoleic">40</a>]</span> and for the determination of glucose (GLC), fructose (FTS) and sucrose (SCR) <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-stitt198932">41</a>]</span>, coupled to the production of 6-phosphogluconate, in the sequential presence of hexokinase, phosphoglucoisomerase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogranase and invertase enzymes. All these analyzes were performed in triplicate.</p>
<p><strong>Physiological analyzes coupled to the aging test.</strong> The relative water content (RWC) of seeds was calculated as described in detail in Vertucci <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-vertucci1993predicting">42</a>]</span> and Moncaleano-Escandon <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-moncaleano2013germination">20</a>]</span>. The water potential (WTP) of the seeds was quantified with the dew point water potential meter (WP4C; Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA), where the seeds were lightly cracked to allow water to pass through the seeds to the internal environment. The values were obtained in MPa. For respiratory rate estimation (RPR), 5% of the seeds used in each storage period were inserted whole in a CO<sub>2</sub> flow chamber (6400-09; LiCOR, Lincoln, NE, USA). For each storage time, 10 different samples were used as replicates. In each measurement procedure of liquid respiration, three cycles of 102 seconds were performed, with a 2 second interval between the readings. During this time the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration inside the chamber was monitored. The reference CO<sub>2</sub> was calibrated, at each measurement, according to the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of the environment (~ 400 μmol CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The net respiration rate was expressed, therefore in μmol CO<sub>2</sub> h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> seed.</p>
<p><strong>Germination tests with aged seeds.</strong> At each evaluation time, 25 seeds of <em>J. curcas</em> were removed from the storage system and germinated in germination boxes containing two sheets of germination test paper soaked with 2x the weight of the paper in water and were sealed and placed in a NT 708 growth chamber (New Technical Instruments, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil). The incubator was equipped with four cold white fluorescent lamps of 20 W with 40 μmoles m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at the level of the germination boxes. The photoperiod was 12 h and the temperature conditions were 25 ± 0.5 °C. Germination assessments were given daily for a period of 25 days. It was considered germinated, the seed whose radicle has emerged from the integument.</p>
<p><strong>Germination tests in the presence of NaCl.</strong> The germination experiment was carried out in a greenhouse at the Federal University of Pernambuco, Department of Botany, Recife, PE (S 8°02“59.0’ W 34°56”54.9’, 4 masl), the average temperature being recorded during the experiments Of 30.6 ± 1.1 °C with a mean relative humidity of 70.4 ± 5.8%. Five different concentrations of NaCl (0, 50, 75, 100 and 150 mM) were tested in the irrigation water, with 0 mM NaCl free treatment in five genotypes of <em>J. curcas</em> (Table <a href="materials-and-methods.html#tab:genotypes">2.1</a>). Before seeding, the seeds were disinfected with NaOCl (2%) for 10 minutes and triply rinsed with distilled water. Next, the seeds were germinated in polypropylene trays (20 x 20 x 5 cm) containing 2500 g of river washed sand, air-dried; Each system containing 25 seeds was considered as an experimental unit. The pots were irrigated daily with 300 mL of water containing Hoagland nutrient solution <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-epstein1972mineral">43</a>]</span> at the final concentration of 25%, this being the volume of irrigation required (ie, previously tested) to leach excess salts and prevent their accumulation in soil. The experiment was evaluated daily for 25 days until the seedlings were collected.</p>
<p><strong>Plant material.</strong> Seeds of <em>J. curcas</em> were supplied by EMBRAPA Agroenergia (Brasília, DF - Brazil), where they were kept at 4 °C until their use, Table <a href="materials-and-methods.html#tab:genotypes">2.1</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation of germination parameters.</strong> For the two experiments the different germination parameters were calculated: germination percentage (GRP), mean germination time (MGT), germination uncertainty (GRU) and germination synchrony (GRS). All calculations, graphs and statistics were performed from the GerminaR package <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-R-GerminaR">44</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of biometric parameters and biomass.</strong> The mean seedling length (SDL) and mean stem diameter (STD) were evaluated at the end of the experiment <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-moncaleano2013germination">20</a>]</span>. For this, the seedlings were collected and separated into three components: leaves, stems and roots. The height of the plants was measured by means of a ruler calibrated in mm and the diameter of the stem measured by a digital caliper (Digital Caliper, ROHS, ZAAS Precision, Piracicaba, SP). Leaf area (LA) was evaluated by plant and for experimental unit (TLA) <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-pompelli2012allometric">45</a>]</span>. The dry biomass was estimated from drying the fabrics in a forced ventilation oven at 70 °C; 72 hours. Leaf dry weight (LDW), dry stem weight (STDW) and root dry weight (RDW) were used to calculate several biomass parameters, such as: total dry weight (TDW); aerial part dry weight (BDW); Leaf weight ratio (LWR; leaf dry weight divided by total dry weight); Dry stem weight ratio (DSR; stem dry weight divided by total dry weight); (RPA, aerial part dry weight divided by total dry weight) and root dry weight ratio (RTR, root dry weight divided by total dry weight).</p>
<p><strong>Experimental design and statistical analysis.</strong> Both germination experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design. For the seed storage experiment, five storage times (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months) were used. The data for the 9 and 12 month plots of the aging experiment were submitted to the calculation of the lost plot. The salinity experiment was composed of a factorial, where five genotypes of <em>J. curcas</em> were tested, and five different concentrations of NaCl in irrigation water (0, 50, 75, 100 and 150 mM) were tested. Each treatment consisted of four replicates with 25 seeds. Statistical analysis and generation of graphs were performed in the statistical software R <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-R-base">46</a>]</span>. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to evaluate the differences between the factors and the comparison of the means with the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p &lt;0.05) <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-R-agricolae">47</a>]</span>. For the multivariate analysis, correlation analysis was performed <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-R-agricolae">47</a>,<a href="#ref-R-corrplot">48</a>]</span> and principal components analysis <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-R-FactoMineR">49</a>]</span>.</p>
